### Introduction to Mobile Robots and Manipulators

- Locomotion
    - If the effect on the environment causes motion of the effector itself
- Manipulation
    - If the effect on the environment causes motion of the object around

- Two Broader Themes of Robotics
    - Human Friendlly(Companion) Robot
    - Smart Industrial (Autonomous) Robot

- Four Pillars of Robotics
    - Mechanical Design and Actuation
    - Sensing, Perception and Navigation
    - Guidance and Motion Planning
    - Motion Control and Task Execution

- Components of Mobile Robot
    - Locomotion
        - how the robot moves through its environment
    - Sensing
        - how the robot measures properties of itself and its environment
    - Reasoning
        - how the robot maps the measurements into actions
    - Control
        - how the robot executes its planned actions
    - Communication
        - how the robot communicates with an outside operator

### Introduction to Locomotion and Types of Locomotion

### Introduction to Mobile Robot Kinematics

- **Kinematics** is study of (the mathematics) of motion without considering the forces/efforts that affect the motion.
    - Deals with the geometric relationships that govern the system.
    - Deals with the relationship between control parameters and the behaviour of a system in state space.

### Degree of Maneuverability and Types of Wheels

- Degree of maneuaverability
    - It is the **sum of degree of mobility and steerability**
    - Includes both
        - Degree of freedom that the robot manipulates directly through wheel velocity 
        - Degree of freedom that it indirectly manipulates by changing the steering configuration and moving
    - In other words, it is the **total number of contollable inputs**
    - Depends on 
        - Kinematic configuration
        - Actuator arrangement
    - Degree of mobility + Degree of steerability
    - (rthn)
- Solid wheels
    - Conventional Wheels
        - Fixed wheels
        - Steered or Rotatable wheels
    - Non-conventional Wheels
        - Omni-directional wheels
        - Mecanum wheels
